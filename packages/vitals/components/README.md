### Tool chain

- Vite for bundling
- Vitest for unit testing

### Core technologies

- [Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
- [Lit](https://lit.dev/)
- [Open web components testing package](https://open-wc.org/docs/testing/testing-package/)

### Get started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:smals-belgium/myhealth.git
npm install
npm start
```

Will start a Vite dev server with a sandbox application to test the Vitals components.

`nx run @myhealth-belgium/vitals:serve`: Serve the component sandbox app
`nx run @myhealth-belgium/vitals:test`: Run unit tests
`nx run @myhealth-belgium/vitals:build`: Build and bundle

### Adding icons

- Add an svg file to the `./src/icon/svg/` dir
- The file name is used as the `vitals-icon` name property, so double check it
- Make sure all svg `path`s have `fill="currentColor"`, otherwise CSS color will not affect the icon
- Preferred box size is 24x24

Currently we use Material icons for backwards compatibility.
SVGs can be downloaded from https://fonts.google.com/icons
